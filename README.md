**Hello!**

If you want to help me and translate Maki to more languages or fix mistakes in existing ones - you are welcome!

You can improve existing translations by clicking on "edit" button and opening pull requests or translate to new languages by modifying `original.xml` in your fork.

Don't forget to write which language it is. 

You can always notify me directly about new translation here to speed up a process:

Of course, I will add you to the app credits.

**Thank you very much in advance!**
